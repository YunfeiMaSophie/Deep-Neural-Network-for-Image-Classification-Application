# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification-Application
A cat vs non-cat deep network with functions implemented in the project "Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step". Supervised Learning.

There is an improvement in accuracy relative to your previous logistic regression implementation, which is in "Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset".  

Let's get started!
