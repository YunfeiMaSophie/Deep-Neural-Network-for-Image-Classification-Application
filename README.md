# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification-Application
When you finish this, you will have finished the last programming assignment of Week 4, and also the last programming assignment of this course!   You will use the functions you'd implemented in the previous assignment to build a deep network, and apply it to cat vs non-cat classification. Hopefully, you will see an improvement in accuracy relative to your previous logistic regression implementation.    **After this assignment you will be able to:** - Build and apply a deep neural network to supervised learning.   Let's get started!
